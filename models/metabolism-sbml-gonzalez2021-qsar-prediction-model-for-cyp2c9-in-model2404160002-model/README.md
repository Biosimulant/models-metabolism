**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2404160002)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Eric Gonzalez; Sankalp Jain; Pranav Shah; Nao Torimoto-Katori; Alexey Zakharov

## Description

Analysis of metabolic stability, determining the inhibition of CYP2C9 activity and whether the compounds are a substrate for the CYP2C9 enzyme. The data used to build these models has been publicly av


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
