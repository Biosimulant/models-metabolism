## Description

This file contains the models, simulation, and generated data that were used in the manuscript 'Erythrocyte Metabolism'. The equations used to create the models were derived from the paper by Dash et 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/metabolism-sbml-erythrocyte-model-of-the-hemoglobin-oxygen-disso-model2305140001-model/model.yaml
