## Description

This is genome-scale metabolic model of Sporopachydermia quercuum as the representative yeast species for the clade Sporopachydermia. This model was generated through homology search using a fungal pa


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
