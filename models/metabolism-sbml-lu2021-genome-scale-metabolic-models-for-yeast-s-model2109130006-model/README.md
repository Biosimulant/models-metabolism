**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Hongzhong Lu; Feiran Li; Le Yuan; Iván Domenzain; Rosemary Yu

## Description

This is genome-scale metabolic model of Lipomyces starkeyi as the representative yeast species for the clade Lipomycetaceae. This model was generated through homology search using a fungal pan-GEM lar


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/metabolism-sbml-lu2021-genome-scale-metabolic-models-for-yeast-s-model2109130006-model/model.yaml
