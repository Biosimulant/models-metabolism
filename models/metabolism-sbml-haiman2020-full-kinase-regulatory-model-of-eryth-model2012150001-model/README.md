**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Zack Haiman; Daniel C Zielinski; Yuko Koike; James T Yurkovich; Palsson BO

## Description

Dynamic model utilizing mass action kinetics to elucidate network-level effects of allosteric regulation in erythrocyte metabolism. The full kinase regulatory model includes the glycolytic pathway, th
