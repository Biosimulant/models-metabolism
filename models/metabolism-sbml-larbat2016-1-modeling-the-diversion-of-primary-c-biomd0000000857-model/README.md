# Larbat2016.1 - Modeling the diversion of primary carbon flux into secondary metabolism under variable nitrate and light or dark conditions (Base Model)

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000857)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Romain Larbat; Christophe Robin; Cathrine Lillo; Tormod Drengstig; Peter Ruoff

## Description

This is a global mathematical model describing metabolic partitioning of carbon resources in plants between growth and defense, as a function of nitrate fertilization. The model hinges on the dynamics


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
