**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Hock Chuan Yeo; Jongkwang Hong; Meiyappan Lakshmanan; Dong-Yup Lee

## Description

The iCHO2291 model was reconstructed by updating the previously published iCHO1766 model in a 6-step procedure: 1) identification and removal of duplicate metabolites and reactions, 2) replacement of 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
