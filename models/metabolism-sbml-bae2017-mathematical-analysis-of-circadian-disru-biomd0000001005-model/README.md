# Bae2017 - Mathematical analysis of circadian disruption and metabolic re-entrainment of hepatic gluconeogenesis

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000001005)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Seul-A Bae; Ioannis P Androulakis

## Description

The circadian rhythms influence the metabolic activity from molecular level to tissue, organ, and host level. Disruption of the circadian rhythms manifests to the host's health as metabolic syndromes,
