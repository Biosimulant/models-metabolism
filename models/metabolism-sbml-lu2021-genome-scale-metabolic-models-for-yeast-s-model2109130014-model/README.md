## Description

This is genome-scale metabolic model of Candida albicans as the representative yeast species for the clade CUG-Ser1. This model was generated through homology search using a fungal pan-GEM largely bas


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
