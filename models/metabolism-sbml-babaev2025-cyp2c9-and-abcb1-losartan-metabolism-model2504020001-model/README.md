# Babaev2025 - CYP2C9 and ABCB1 losartan metabolism model

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2504020001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Dmitry Babaev; Elena Kutumova; Fedor Kolpakov

## Description

The model can simultaneously predict the profiles of both losartan and its active metabolite, E-3174, based on a given patient's CYP2C9 and ABCB1 genotypes.The CYP2C9 alleles considered are CYP2C9*1 a


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
